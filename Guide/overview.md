#Introduction to Pthreads

Pthreads (POSIX threads) is a standard API (Application Programming Interface) for creating and managing threads in a POSIX-compliant operating system. It provides a mechanism for creating and managing lightweight threads that can run in parallel and communicate with each other using various synchronization mechanisms. Pthreads library is a part of POSIX standard and is available on many operating systems, including Linux, Unix, and macOS.

##Why use Pthreads?

Pthreads library provides a way to create multithreaded applications that can take advantage of multi-core processors and execute multiple tasks concurrently, which can lead to significant performance gains. With pthreads, you can write code that performs I/O operations, computation, and other tasks in parallel, making your program more responsive and efficient.
